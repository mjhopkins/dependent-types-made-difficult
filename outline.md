# Dependent types made difficult

- Conal Elliott "Compiling to Categories"

- What is categorical semantics?

- Curry-Howard
- Curry-Howard-Lambek

- the operations of forming the internal language and the category of contexts are adjoint functors



- What's an adjunction?

- example: free monoid
- example: vector space
- example: quantifiers

- What about dependent types?

- What are dependent types?
  Martin-LÃ¶f
- type expressions can contain terms
- it's the Curry-Howard equivalent of predicate logic 
- identity types
- sigma types
- pi types

- Modelling a dependent type as a display map

intuitive approach: model as set-valued function
flip around, view backwards


- Substitution (is pullback)
